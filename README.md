### Notes
Most of the additions made to Flixster 1 app went pretty smoothly, actually, and I had more of an understanding of what I was doing. Though I spent quite a while trying to figure out one error which I eventually went to Slack to ask for help for and it was simply a 0 instead of an O in the API key, causing the app to run but not properly when viewing the Superhero screen view.

### Notes
The process, overall, was smoother since I had at least some experience with Xcode this time around, compared to previous projects. I was much better navigated,
however, I encountered difficulty on the installation of cocoapods, specifically because it couldn't "link to a native gem file". Eventually, I realized it was
simply because I never linked my Xcode in preferences-->locations command line tool so the terminal process took a little experimentation before I got that to
work. Overall, I had fun installing this app and hopefully learned something (though it was a lot of syntax I didn't understand, I will be familiarizing myself
with the overall process Tim used to create this app.
